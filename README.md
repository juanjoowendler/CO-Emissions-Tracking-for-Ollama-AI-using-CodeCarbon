# CO₂ Emissions Tracking with CodeCarbon

## Context
This project is part of a practical assignment aimed at quantifying the carbon footprint generated by running Python code. It uses the CodeCarbon library to track energy consumption and the associated CO₂ emissions.

Additionally, it calculates how many hours of processing can be offset by a newly planted tree, assuming it absorbs approximately 30 kg of CO₂ in its first year of life.

## Project Approach
1. **Tracker Initialization:** An instance of `EmissionsTracker` from CodeCarbon is started at the beginning of the execution.  
2. **Time Measurement:** The execution time of the code is recorded to calculate the emission rate per second and per hour.  
3. **User Interaction:** A loop allows the user to send queries to an AI model (module `llamarIA.get_llm_response`) until they type `exit`.  
4. **Emissions Calculation:** At the end, the tracker is stopped and the total carbon emissions (kg CO₂) are retrieved.  
5. **Offset Calculation:** Based on the hourly emissions, it determines how many processing hours are equivalent to the 30 kg of CO₂ absorbed by a tree in one year.  
6. **Results Export:** Metrics are stored in a `resultados.csv` file and displayed in the console.
