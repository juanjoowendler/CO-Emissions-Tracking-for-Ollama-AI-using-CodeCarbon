# AI telemetry and emissions analysis system

Python tool that measures energy consumption and CO₂ emissions generated by the execution of code generated with artificial intelligence.

### Main idea:
Raising awareness about the environmental impact of software by measuring real consumption metrics.


### Technologies used:
- Python
- CodeCarbon
- Ollama (local AI model)
- Pandas


### Architectural aspects:
- Emissions measurement decoupled from the main flow
- Structured logging of metrics in a file
- Console interaction with controlled flow
- Environmental impact calculation and compensation
- Exporting results to CSV
